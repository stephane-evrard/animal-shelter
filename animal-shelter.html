                <p>Cats are an enigma that have captured the hearts of people for thousands of years. Their mysterious
                    personalities and adorable looks have made them an incredibly popular pet, and according to a survey
                    18% of households in the UK alone are ruled by a cat. With so many cats around us, surely that would
                    mean that everyone knows everything possible about them, right? Wrong! There are so many interesting
                    facts about cats that you probably haven’t heard of, from the world’s largest cat, to the surprising
                    way they walk</p>
                <p>This interesting fact about cats is guaranteed to wow at your next dinner party. Did you know that
                    originally it was thought that Egyptians domesticated the cat? But in 2004, French archaeologists
                    discovered a 9,500 year old cat grave in Cyprus. This makes this the oldest known pet cat and it
                    predates Egyptian art about cats by over 4,000 years!</p>

                <p>At The Drake Center for Veterinary Care, our approach to canine veterinary medicine revolves around a
                    comprehensive, competent and compassionate care program, aimed at ensuring the highest quality of
                    life for your dog. Perhaps the greatest measure of our success is found in our many happy patients
                    and kind words from our clients. We value the long term relationship we have with many of our
                    clients. Through good communication and trust we have built so many great relationships with our
                    clients which allow us to partner with our clients to provide the best care for their dog. Some of
                    the recent feedback from our clients can be found here.</p>
                <p>understand that a dog veterinarian is only as good as his or her ability to successfully prevent,
                    diagnose and treat whatever ailment a dog may be facing. Equally as important is our ability to
                    listen and communicate well with owners to make sure they understand their dog's health concerns and
                    how to make the best choices for their dog. This is why our dog hospital is capable of handling any
                    procedure including preventive care, medical diagnosis and emergency surgery.</p>
